# Ebookama

A small, extensible program to take the pain away from repetitive ebook wrangling

### Installation

This program requires node.js and npm to be installed on your machine. Until we have time to put instructions here, head to [Google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=install+node).

Once you've got node and npm installed, you need to get this repository on your computer. Ways to do that, in order of goodness:

- Fork this repo, then clone your fork to your machine (requires installation and understanding of Git)
- Clone this repo to your machine (requires installation and understanding of Git)
- Download the repo and unzip it. You won't be able to easily update the program when we inevitably fix all the bugs we never thought of.

Now that you have the program on your computer, you need to set it up. Don't worry, it's easy. Open the terminal or command line, navigate to this repo on your hard drive, and run the following command (the `$` just means "type this in the terminal and press enter"):

```
$ npm install
```

That's it. You're done.
